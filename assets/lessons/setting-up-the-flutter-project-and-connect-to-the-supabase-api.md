# Setting up the Flutter project and Connect to the Supabase API

In this section, we will go over the steps to set up a Flutter project for the [educative.io](http://educative.io/) clone app, including adding dependencies and assets. We will also cover how to configure environment variables and connect to the Supabase API using the `supabase_flutter` package. Once we have completed these steps, we will be ready to start building our [educative.io](http://educative.io/) clone app. Let's get started! ðŸš€

## Project structure

```
educative_clone_app/
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lessons/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ themes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ widgets/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.dart
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

The project structure for our Flutter application is shown above. 

- The `lib` directory contains the source code for our application, organized into different directories based on the purpose of the code.
- The `pages` directory contains the UI pages of our application.
- The `widgets` directory contains reusable widgets that can be used on multiple pages.
- The `themes` directory contains the theme data for our application.
- The `models` directory contains data models used throughout the application.
- The `controllers` directory contains business logic for our application.
- The `assets` directory contains the assets used in our application, such as images and data files.
- The `assets/lessons` directory contains the lesson files in markdown format. To save a lesson file in markdown format, we can create a new file with a `.md` extension and save it in the `assets/lessons` directory. We can then load this file in our Flutter application using the `flutter_markdown` package.
- The `main.dart` file is the entry point for our Flutter application.

## Adding Dependencies

To add dependencies to our Flutter project, we need to update the `pubspec.yaml` file that is located in the root directory of our project. This file is used to list the dependencies that our project needs to run. To add a dependency, we need to specify the package name and the version number.

Here are some commonly used dependencies that we can add to our project:

- `any_link_preview: ^3.0.0`: This package provides an easy way to extract metadata from a URL, such as title, description, and image.
- `cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2`: This package provides the Cupertino icons that are used in iOS-style Flutter applications.
- `flutter: sdk: flutter`: This is the SDK for Flutter.
- `flutter_dotenv: ^5.0.2`: This package provides a way to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- `flutter_markdown: ^0.6.14`: This package provides a way to display Markdown text in our Flutter application.
- `flutter_riverpod: ^2.3.2`: This package provides a simple way to manage state in our Flutter application.
- `flutter_svg: ^2.0.4`: This package provides a way to display SVG images in our Flutter application.
- `flutter_syntax_view: ^4.0.0`: This package provides a way to display code syntax highlighting in our Flutter application.
- `flutter_widget_from_html: ^0.10.0`: This package provides a way to display HTML content in our Flutter application.
- `google_fonts: ^4.0.3`: This package provides a way to use custom fonts in our Flutter application.
- `readmore: ^2.2.0`: This package provides a way to display a "Read More" link for long text.
- `shimmer: ^2.0.0`: This package provides a way to display a shimmering effect in our Flutter application.
- `supabase_flutter: ^1.5.0`: This package provides a way to use the Supabase API in our Flutter application.
- `url_launcher: ^6.1.10`: This package provides a way to launch URLs in our Flutter application.

We can add these dependencies to our project by specifying the package name and version number in the `dependencies` section of the `pubspec.yaml` file. For example, to add the `flutter_markdown` package, we can add the following line to the `dependencies` section:

```yaml
flutter_markdown: ^0.6.14

```

Once we have added the dependencies to the `pubspec.yaml` file, we can run the `flutter packages get` command in our terminal or in the IDE terminal to download the packages and update our project.

## Adding assets

To download the assets for this Flutter project, please follow the URL below:

[](https://devmvhbamfosnfrpcjve.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/assets/assets.zip)

This URL will take you to a page where you can download a `.zip` file containing all the assets for this project. Once you have downloaded the file, you can extract the contents to the `assets` directory in the root directory of your Flutter project.

After downloading and extracting the assets, the `assets` directory in the root directory of your Flutter project should contain a `lessons` subdirectory, which contains the lesson files in markdown format, and any other asset files needed for the project.

The `assets` directory is where we store all the assets for our Flutter application, such as images and data files. It is important to declare the assets in the `pubspec.yaml` file, so that Flutter knows to include them in the application. To do this, we can add the following lines to the `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/lessons/

```

These lines tell Flutter to include all files in the `assets/` and `assets/lessons/` directories as assets in our application. Once we have declared the assets in the `pubspec.yaml` file, we can load the assets in our Flutter application using the `rootBundle` object provided by the *`flutter/src/services/asset_bundle.dart`* package, or using the `NetworkAssetBundle` object to load assets from a remote URL. The `rootBundle` object is used to load assets that are bundled with our application, while the `NetworkAssetBundle` object is used to load assets from a remote server. 

## Setup .env file

To store sensitive information like Supabase URL and Supabase Anon Key, we will create a `.env` file in the root directory of our project. This file will contain key-value pairs for the environment variables that we want to use in our Flutter application.

To create the `.env` file, we can use a text editor to create a new file in the root directory of our project and name it `.env`.

In the `.env` file, we will define the following environment variables:

```toml
SUPABASE_URL=<your_supabase_url>
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your_supabase_anon_key>

```

Replace `<your_supabase_url>` with the URL of your Supabase project, and `<your_supabase_anon_key>` with your Supabase Anon Key.

## Get Supabase URL and Supabase Anon Key

To get the Supabase URL and Supabase Anon Key, we need to go to our Supabase project dashboard and click on the `Project Settings` tab. In the `API` section, we can find our Supabase URL and Anon Key, which we can copy and paste into our `.env` file. It is important to keep these values private and not share them with anyone, as they provide access to our Supabase project.

## Configure .env file in pubspec.yaml

Make sure that the `flutter_dotenv` package is included in the `pubspec.yaml` file, so that we can use the environment variables defined in the `.env` file in our Flutter application. The `pubspec.yaml` file should include the following lines:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_dotenv: ^5.0.2  # Add this line

flutter:
  uses-material-design: true

  # Assets
  assets:
		- .env  # Add this line  
    - assets/
    - assets/lessons/

```

These lines tell Flutter to include the `flutter_dotenv` package as a dependency in our project and to include the `.env` file as an asset so that the environment variables can be accessed.

## Configure .env file in .gitignore (Optional)

To prevent the sensitive information in the `.env` file from being pushed to the repository, we need to add the `.env` file to the `.gitignore` file.

Add the following line to the `.gitignore` file:

```
.env

```

This line tells Git to ignore the `.env` file when committing changes.

## Configure Flutter code to connect with Supabase

To use the `supabase_flutter` package in your Flutter project, ensure that it is included as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file. To do this, add the following line to the `dependencies` section:

```yaml
supabase_flutter: ^1.5.0

```

This will enable you to use the package in your project.

Once we have added the `supabase_flutter` package to our project, we can import the `supabase_flutter.dart` file in our `main.dart` file using the `import` statement:

```dart
import 'package:supabase_flutter/supabase_flutter.dart';

```

After importing the `supabase_flutter.dart` file, we can initialize the `Supabase` object with the Supabase URL and Anon Key environment variables defined in the `.env` file. To do this, we can use the `Supabase.initialize` method:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_dotenv/flutter_dotenv.dart';
import 'package:supabase_flutter/supabase_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  await dotenv.load(fileName: ".env");

  final supabaseUrl = dotenv.get('SUPABASE_URL');
  final supabaseAnonKey = dotenv.get('SUPABASE_ANON_KEY');

  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  await Supabase.initialize(
    url: supabaseUrl,
    anonKey: supabaseAnonKey,
  );

  runApp(const MyApp());
}

```

In the code above, we first ensure that the Flutter bindings are initialized by calling `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`. We then load the environment variables from the `.env` file using the `dotenv.load(fileName: ".env")` method. Next, we get the Supabase URL and Anon Key environment variables from the `dotenv.get('<key>')`and store them in two variables, `supabaseUrl` and `supabaseAnonKey`. Finally, we initialize the `Supabase` object using the `Supabase.initialize` method with the Supabase URL and Anon Key environment variables, and then we run our Flutter application.

After setting up the `Supabase` object, we can use it to interact with the Supabase API in our Flutter application.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully set up our Flutter project ****and added dependencies and assets to it. You have also learned how to configure environment variables using a `.env` file and use the `supabase_flutter` package to connect with the Supabase API. Now we are ready to start building our [educative.io](http://educative.io) Clone App! Happy coding! ðŸš€

Full `main.dart` code:

```dart
import 'package:educative_app_clone/pages/home_page.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_dotenv/flutter_dotenv.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:supabase_flutter/supabase_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  await dotenv.load(fileName: ".env");

  final supabaseUrl = dotenv.get('SUPABASE_URL');
  final supabaseAnonKey = dotenv.get('SUPABASE_ANON_KEY');

  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  await Supabase.initialize(
    url: supabaseUrl,
    anonKey: supabaseAnonKey,
  );

  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const ProviderScope(
      child: MaterialApp(
        debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
        title: 'Educative',
        home: HomePage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the code above, we wrap our `MaterialApp()` widget with the `ProviderScope()` widget to enable state management with `flutter_riverpod`. This allows us to use the `Provider()` and `Consumer()` widgets to manage and access the state throughout our application.
