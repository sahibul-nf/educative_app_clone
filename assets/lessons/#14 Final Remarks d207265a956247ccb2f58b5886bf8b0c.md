# #14  Final Remarks

Congratulations on completing this comprehensive tutorial for building an education platform using Flutter and Supabase! We hope you found this guide helpful in developing your own education platform from scratch.

Throughout this tutorial, we have covered the basic concepts of Flutter and Supabase, including how to integrate them to create a fully functional education platform, similar to [educative.io](http://educative.io/). We provided step-by-step instructions, starting from setting up the development environment, installing the necessary tools, and creating a new Flutter project. We then delved into creating the UI components and integrating Supabase to store and retrieve data.

By the end of this tutorial, you should have a fully working education platform built with Flutter and Supabase and a better understanding of how to use these technologies together to create powerful applications.

But, the learning doesn't have to stop here. There's always more to learn and explore in the world of app development. Below are some suggestions for further learning:
